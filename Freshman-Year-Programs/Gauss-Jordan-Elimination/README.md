This code uses Gauss-Jordan elimination algorithm to solve given equations.
Gauss-Jordan elimination algorithm is used to solve given equations using Matrix.
Equations may have only one value. Unaccepted equations;
x+y=5z+3t
x=4t+3z

Accepted equations;
x+y-5z=3t
x-4t=3z
x+y+t=z

A simple example;

x+y=3
x-y=5

Created matrix will me like this;

[ 1, 1, 3]
[ 1,-1, 5]

We seperate this array into two parts; Variables and values

[ 1, 1| 3]
[ 1,-1| 5]

If we add second raw to the first

[ 2, 0| 8]
[ 1,-1| 5]

Divide the first raw by two to get the valua of x
[ 1, 0| 4]
[ 1,-1| 5]

Multiply the second raw with -1

[ 1, 0| 4]
[-1, 1|-5]

Add the first raw to the second

[ 1, 0| 4]
[ 0, 1|-1]

And now we have the value of the variables

x + 0*y = 4, x=4
0*x + y = -1, y=-1

If you get results like 1.00#INDO00 this means your equation cannot be solved.
Some examples for unsolveable equations;

x1+x2=3
x1+x2=5

x1-x2=3
x1-2x2=3
x1+0x2=4
