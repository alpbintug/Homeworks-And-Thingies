# Homework and thingies

This repository focuses on my first programs as a Computer Engineering Student.
I am not going to edit those codes to see how much I improved myself. But I will add comment lines and change the variable names to more understandable things (Trust me I don't even know why I named my variables like "a,b,c,d,i,j,k,q,w,x")

When I finish uploading all my codes (Atleast the ones I can find) from freshman year, I will continue to my 2nd year programs and start uploading them.
