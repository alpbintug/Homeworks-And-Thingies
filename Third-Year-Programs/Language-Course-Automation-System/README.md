# Homework from my Software Engineering class
### Homework goals;
Create an efficient system which help Admin to manage their multi-department multi-branch Language Course with ease.
This system must contain information about departments, classes in departments, teachers, students, courses.
Admin must be able to manage departments with ease and create courses accordingly. 
Students should be able to keep track of their debt and lessons.
In this project I was responsible of the development of the Graphical User Interface (GUI) and I helped to write some of the SQL Queries.

## GUI
My goal on designing the GUI was to create a simple and a modern GUI which would help users to navigate through pages and understand what is going on with ease. I choose to create the GUI in "Dark Mode" (Anyone is still using light-mode UI's? Shame.) UI which has dark background colours and warm (Red/Orange/Gold) foreground colours.

## Database
I did not design or create the database but I helped to write the SQL queries (The ones that make no sense are probably mine).

## UI Functions
I developed the most of button functionalities in this project.
