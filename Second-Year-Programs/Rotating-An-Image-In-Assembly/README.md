## Rotating an image in Assembly (80x86) programming language

In this homework, we are asked to write two functions who will turn an image to the left or to the right. Program is given to us and we are asked to write those two functions using inline assembly in Visual Studio.

Rotate-Left.asm and Rotate-Right.asm files are also in main.cpp, I posted them separately to reading clearity.

#### I will address the algorithm later on
